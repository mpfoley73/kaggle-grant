```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


A cursory, univariate review of the newly encoded data uncovers a few  interesting relationships with the response.


# Setup

```{r message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(caret)
```


# Load Data

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
load("./grant_01.RData")
training <- training %>% select(Class, sort(colnames(training)))
glimpse(training)
```


# Univariate Analysis

What continuous variables are likely to be important predictors of the response variable?
